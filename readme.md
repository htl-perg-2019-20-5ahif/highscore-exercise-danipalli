## Setup Info

- I wrote a `docker-compose.yml` with which you are able to start the space shooter
- It starts the space-shooter-client, the space-shooter-api and the mssql database for storing the highscores
- I already built all of the required images with the dockerfiles (you find them in the project folders) and pushed them to my Docker Hub Account, so you can simply start my project with `docker-compose up`
